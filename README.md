### Interesting Articles and Visualizations

This link leads to an article about an mixer about data science in game development. It caught my interest because it was talking about how companies gather data from users to then analyze to create a better overall experience for their games.

![I like it because it shows the different ways the data(money) is earned and used](https://sankeyart-static.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Apple_FY22_NoYOY.width-800.png)

I like this visualization because it divides the main group of Revenue into 2 groups income and expediture, and also futher divides the groups into smaller and smaller groups withing the category.
